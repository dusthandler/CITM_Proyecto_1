Last Resort is one of the greatest arcade shoot 'em up videogames because of his great technical quality for the times of his release and it's very well-known for his challenging and brutally difficulty. The original version of the game was released in 1992 for NeoGeo Arcade Systems by SNK. Later was released for NeoGeo CD. Since then, was remastered in SNK Arcade Classics Vol.1 for the PS2, PSP and Wii in 2007 and later on, in 2017, for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. This game is an spiritual sequel of R-Type, because of the similarity of their mechanics. Also, his art was very inspired on the manga Akira.
